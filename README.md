# Annotation-Graph-Platform

# Introduction

Due to the recent advances in machine learning, object and/or face recognition can be performed rapidly and accurately. However, making decisions based on these annotations is as important as  Annotation graph platform is a project with the principal aim of drawing meaningful conclusions and insights from annotated images, by taking streams of annotation data and mapping it to a graph database. 

This procedure creates a dynamicly evolving weighted complex network of images annotations. The nodes (or vertices) of this network are the annotations themselves, and an edge is created between two annotations when they are identified in the same image (or frame, if the source is a video). The edge weight is increased when the same pair of annotations are detected in a consequent image. For example, if John and Jill are both present in 10 images, they are represented by two vertices connected by an edge of strength 10.
